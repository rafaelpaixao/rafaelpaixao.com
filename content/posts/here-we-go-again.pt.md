I'm finally back! Now trying some of this [Hugo's](https://gohugo.io/) magic.. and it feels pretty good. ðŸ˜Ž

To keep this place clean and shining, I'm thinking of throwing weekly short posts about whatever I had been doing.

Like most of the world, I have been quarentined for the last 2.. 3.. months?
Luckily, I'm capable of doing all my work (enterprise web software development) from home and have the basic infraestructure (fast internet) to do so.

After a while, I even bought a new desk e reorganized my forniture to make my "work isle" (or [work nest](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheImportanceOfNestingWhenRemoteWorkingAndQuarantineWorking.aspx)?) feel more like it.

Even so, we should remember that the world status is still "crazy as hell", and working from home WHILE in quanrentine can be very complicated. More than ever, it's important to have some fun and here is some humor from [Invisible Bread](https://invisiblebread.com/):
